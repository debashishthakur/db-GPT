# Project Directory README

Welcome to the project directory for db-GPT! This directory contains the code and resources for the project. Below, you'll find an overview of the contents and instructions on how to get started.

## Contents

- **gf2_model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the Hugging Face model. It's where the model is loaded and it generates SQL queries.

- **app.py**: This is the main Flask application for our project. It serves as the entry point for our web application.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the required dependencies for our project. Before running the application, make sure to install these dependencies.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


2. **Start the Flask Server**: After all the dependencies are installed, you can start the Flask server by running: flask --app app --debug run


This will start the web application, and you can access it in your web browser.

That's it! You're now ready to use the project. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please refer to reach out to me.

Thank you for exploring the project, and I hope you find it valuable!
