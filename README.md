## Overview
db-GPT is built on state-of-the-art technology, using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model comprising an encoder and a decoder. It's designed to make your database interactions more intuitive and accessible. Whether you're a developer, data analyst, or someone who wants to access data without SQL knowledge, db-GPT has you covered.

## How it Works
Simply input your natural language query, and db-GPT will process it into an SQL query that the database can understand. It then fetches the relevant data and provides you with the results – all within seconds.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts everyday language into SQL queries.
- **Speed**: Lightning-fast translation and data retrieval.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for users with no SQL background.
- **Open Source**: You can contribute to and customize db-GPT to your needs.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the db-GPT server.
4. Start sending your natural language queries.

## Dataset and Model
We've trained db-GPT using the Spider dataset, which covers a wide range of SQL queries. Our model has learned to understand your queries and translate them into SQL effectively.

## Word Embeddings
To enhance the language understanding, db-GPT uses the GloVe word embeddings, which provide valuable context and meaning to the words used in your queries.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve db-GPT. Whether it's adding new features, improving accuracy, or expanding database compatibility, your input is valuable. Feel free to fork this repository and make a pull request.

##Note
This project is still under construction and there is a large room for improvement. This sequence to sequence model is trained on a very small dataset and is only meant for learning purposes. (This project was a part of an assignment that was assigned to me by an organisation)
